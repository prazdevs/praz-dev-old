A webapp made for streamer [Vicksy](https://twitch.tv/vicksy)'s community to organize a League of Legends tournament between members of the community. The app is built on top of Firebase. 

The goal of the app is to build a complex React app, with all the UX/UI concepts it brings, as well as accessibility concerns.
