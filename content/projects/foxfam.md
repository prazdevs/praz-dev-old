A webapp made for streamer [Vicksy](https://twitch.tv/vicksy)'s community to organize a League of Legends tournament between members of the community. It implements account creation and summoner verification through calls to the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

This project has been stopped and will be rewritten completely using NestJs.
