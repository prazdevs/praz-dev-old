A discord bot that shares from Reddit to Discord with moderation features. This bot is running for [r/Zoemains](https://reddit.com/r/zoemains), a community of over 24k people!

- Automatically fetch and post Reddit submissions to a given public channel!
- Posts can be reviewed (and accepted or rejected) by moderators before being posted in the public channel.
- Posts can be automodded after a given delay. They will be checked over Reddit and accepted automatically if they have not been removed or deleted.

I still maintain this project and will add more features to it.
