Hey, I'm **Sacha 'PraZ' Bouillez**. I have been running by that name on the internet for quite a while now. I'm a 24 year old developer, currently based in Lille, FR.

Being curious by nature, I am self taught on most of the languages and frameworks I use: learning constantly and the will to improve every day is what makes me enjoy coding so much.
