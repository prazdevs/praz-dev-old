I value other people's work as much (if not more) as mine. So I need to thank the people that direclty helped me making this website:

- My wife, for being supportive and bearing with my constant nerding around â™¡
- [Quiet Hush](https://twitter.com/q_hush) for the icon of the website and lots of art
- [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com) for the convenient Sass base called [Primitive](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for the great documentation and the [default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

...and everyone involved in the making of any dependency or plugin that this website and any of my project uses, as well as the communities that contribute to sharing the knowledge and passion of code.
